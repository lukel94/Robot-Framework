Options:
 -v                 Lists the current version number.
 -d                 Runs the differencing function.
                      If not specified, runs the counting function.
 -i1 <fileListA>    Filename containing filenames in the Baseline A.
 -i2 <fileListB>    Filename containing filenames in the Baseline B.
 -t <#>             Specifies the threshold percentage for a modified line.
                      (DEFAULTS TO 60).
 -visualdiff        Enables visual differencing.
 -tdup <#>          Specifies the threshold percentage for duplicated files -
                      the maximum percent difference between two files of the
                      same name in a baseline to be considered duplicates.
                      (DEFAULTS TO 0)
 -trunc <#>         Specifies the maximum number of characters allowed in a
                      logical SLOC. Additional characters will be truncated.
                      (DEFAULTS TO 10,000, use 0 for no truncation)
 -cf                Indicated that target files were retrieved from ClearCase.
                      Restored the original filename before counting.
 -dir               Specifies the following directories and file specifications: 
      <dirA>          Name of the directory containing source files.
                        If -d is given, dirA is the directory for Baseline A.
      <dirB>          Name of the directory for Baseline B only if -d is given.
      <fileSpecs>     File specifications, wildcard chars ? * are allowed.
                        For example, *.cpp *.h
 -outdir <outDir>   Specifies the directory to store the output files.
 -extfile <extFile> Indicates language extension mapping filename
 -unified           Prints language report files to a single unified report file.
 -ascii             Prints ASCII text report files instead of CSV files.
 -legacy            Prints legacy formatted ASCII text report files
                      instead of the current format of the CSV or text files.
 -nodup             Disables separate processing of duplicate files.
 -nocomplex         Disables printing complexity reports or keyword counts.
 -cc4enable         Enables Cyclomatic Complexity 4 unique condition metrics.
 -nolinks           Disables following symbolic links to directories and files.
 -threads <#>       Specify the number of work threads. Minimum is 2.
                      If not specified then no work threads are created.
 -ramlimit <#>      Specify RAM limit used for estimation of success
                      in 100 MB increments. Minimum is 1
                      and maximum is 5120.  10 will be about 1 GigaByte.
                      If not specified then default is 500 MBytes RAM.
                      If  unlikely to succeed  shows, UCC will try anyway.
 -nowarnings        Disables warning messages on console.
                      Warning messages will still be logged.
                      Error messages will still show on console.
 -nouncounted       Disables reports or messages about uncounted files.
 -help <option>     Displays this usage or usage for a specified option.
